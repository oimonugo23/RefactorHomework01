# Horiseon

## Description 
 This Assignment was designed to help specify changes made to the html and css file for a website that allows the front-end developer to know more what the tag is describing. Using html semantics, clarity was provided in the tags and in the Css File, changes were made to cut down on redundancy of class items but still preserve the website in its original state.
